👋 Hi, I’m Saijai Osika
  
🤝 As a Support Account Manager at Broadcom, I elevated customer satisfaction by streamlining the end-to-end support journey, including efficient onboarding, proactive daily ticket reviews, expedited escalation turnaround, and impactful monthly and quarterly reviews. Collaborating with engineering and product teams, I championed the voice of the customer and field feedback while partnering with sales, account teams, and solution architects to develop strategic plans for upgrades, implementations, and client success. These efforts directly contributed to significant upsells and successful renewals.
  
🌱 As a problem solver, I excel at identifying root causes, implementing effective solutions, and collaborating across teams to address complex challenges, ensuring seamless operations, enhanced customer satisfaction, and measurable business outcomes.
  
📈 a program manager, I have a laser focus on improving processes and prioritizing initiatives to drive efficiency, foster cross-functional collaboration, and deliver impactful results that align with organizational goals and customer needs.
  
💞️ I take pride in my technical achievements, including developing a Flight Buddy tool using full-stack JavaScript to streamline resolution times and provide a visual representation of flight data. Expanding my expertise into data engineering, I built a LinkedIn Job ETL pipeline leveraging AWS technologies. Recently, I delved into Artificial Intelligence and created an AI Job Recommendation Assistant powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo model, designed to curate job recommendations tailored to resumes for a perfect fit.
  
👀 I am seeking a new opportunity as an AI Program Manager to drive efficient, cost-effective solutions in a fast-paced, innovative organization, leveraging AI technologies to tackle complex challenges and deliver impactful results.
